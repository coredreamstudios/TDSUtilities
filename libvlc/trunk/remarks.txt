Remarks about VlcDeployment.

If you use CheckVlcLibraryExistence(bool checkHashes, bool tryLoad) with tryLoad = true, it may
cause the incorrect vlc behaviour when it will be reinitialized with other options (for example,
plugins can be unavailable after such check).

Recommended to use with FALSE parameter.


TODO :

Implement:
- Input-output MRLs generation and test it for network streaming and device capturing, transcoding

Refactor:
- Logging thread in VlcMediaLibraryFactory
- Disposing in PanelledDoubleWindow
	
Improve compatibility with VlcDeployment

Build for Mono 2.0 including SimplePlayer.

SimplePlayer :
- information about every movie
- more functionality in playlist
- playlist modes (repeat, random)


FUTURE:

- Support for DirectX without VLC
